# The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

## Be Proactive

Covey highlights the importance of taking initiative. Instead of reacting to circumstances, proactive individuals focus on their Circle of Influence and take ownership of their actions.

## Begin with the End in Mind

This habit encourages creating a personal mission statement. Visualizing your goals helps align daily actions with long-term aspirations.

## Put First Things First

Effective time management is about prioritizing tasks that align with your values. Covey introduces the Time Management Matrix to differentiate urgent and important tasks.

## Think Win-Win

Win-win is about seeking mutual benefit in relationships. Covey stresses collaboration and avoiding zero-sum approaches in partnerships.
