# Mindset: The New Psychology of Success

## The Growth Mindset

Carol Dweck explains the Growth Mindset, where abilities and intelligence can be developed through effort. This contrasts with the Fixed Mindset, which assumes abilities are static.

## Why Mindsets Matter

Your mindset shapes how you perceive success and failure. A Growth Mindset leads to resilience, while a Fixed Mindset creates fear of failure.

## Changing Your Mindset

Dweck provides practical strategies to shift from a Fixed Mindset to a Growth Mindset, including reframing challenges as opportunities.

## How to Foster Growth in Others

Parents, teachers, and leaders can instill a Growth Mindset in others by praising effort, not just results.
